# Momentumjjap
replica of the Momentum wepapp

- this app is coded by ***js*** with *html, css*.
- momentumjjap will help me to recall the todo-list by watching the screen (ã…Ž)
- Also this app has the function that show "What time is it now?"
- I'm still working on it, so this app is very very low in completeness.
